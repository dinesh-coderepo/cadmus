    "# Cross-Validation\n",

    "## Description\n",
    "Cross-validation is a statistical method used to estimate the performance of machine learning models. It involves partitioning the data into subsets, training the model on some subsets, and validating it on the remaining subsets. This process is repeated multiple times to obtain a reliable estimate of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance\n",
    "Cross-validation is important because it provides a more accurate estimate of a model's performance compared to a single train-test split. It helps in detecting overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Techniques\n",
    "There are several techniques for cross-validation, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "K-Fold cross-validation involves dividing the data into K subsets (folds). The model is trained on K-1 folds and validated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated K times, with each fold being used as the validation set once. The final performance is the average of the K validation scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "Stratified K-Fold cross-validation is similar to K-Fold cross-validation, but it ensures that each fold has a similar distribution of the target variable. This is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)\n",
    "LOOCV is an extreme case of K-Fold cross-validation where K is equal to the number of data points. The model is trained on all data points except one and validated on the remaining data point. This process is repeated for each data point. LOOCV provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance but can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Series Cross-Validation\n",
    "Time series cross-validation is used for time-dependent data. It involves splitting the data into training and validation sets based on time, ensuring that the validation set always comes after the training set. This technique is useful for evaluating models on time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice\n",
    "For practical examples and exercises on cross-validation techniques, refer to the [Cross-Validation Notebook](02_cross_validation.ipynb).\n"
